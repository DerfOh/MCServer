todo list
todo list format

(solved/unsolved) thing that needs to be done/comment
who is working on it, who else is working on it, ect
questions about the problem, add lines tabbed or spaced in if needed
  like so?
anything else

(unsolved)Though this will be one of the last things I would like to see an actual gui that is very user friendly
